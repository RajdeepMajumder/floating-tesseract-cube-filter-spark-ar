# floating-tesseract-cube-filter-spark-ar

## Inspiration
I was watching the Avengers movie and I was fascinated by the Tesseract cube. I wanted to create a 3d world filter with a plain tracker to bring my idea to life and thus created this project.
## What it does
The main camera of the device is used by this filter on Instagram to project a hologram of a floating tesseract cube with plain and object tracking capability.
## How I built it
I used spark ar to make this filter and I used a free to use 3d tesseract cube model from sketchfab under creative commons license.
## Challenges I ran into
The main challenge was to make a script that runs all the stuff which i wanted to cover using this filter, i user youtube videos to guide me thorugh the challenges and the project completed successfully. This was my first hackathon and i am a solo participant so I had to figure out my mistakes and make my own way around the bugs and challenges.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I happy that I could ccomplete this challenge, and completed this in time.
## What I learned
I learned how to keep the size small for uploading the filter.
## What's next for Floating Tesseract
Gonna make it more realistic, but might need some help. Get in touch if you want to help me out! It will be epic!!!
